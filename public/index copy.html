<h1>Swastik's All Time Best Movies</h1>
<h2>My all time favourite movies</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Ratatouille</h3>
<p>This is my favourite animated movie, maybe even my favourite movie ever.</p>
<h3>Rock On</h3>
<p>Very well made Bollywood movie, and very close to my heart. I can never get tired of watching this movie.</p>
<h3>Manchester By The Sea</h3>
<p>There's just something special about this movie. The slow paced story somehow manages to not be boring or feel long.</p>
